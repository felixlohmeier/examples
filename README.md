# Taskfile examples

This repository contains examples of common uses for Taskfiles.

- [Go Web App][gowebapp] with live-reloading and compiling everything in a
  single binary
- [OpenRefine batch processing][openrefine] (import, transform, export) using task and the openrefine-client to control OpenRefine via its HTTP API

TODO:

- Using Task to build Docker containers

# Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome. The examples should be simple and show
an useful use case for [Task][task].
